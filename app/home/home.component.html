<h1>Home</h1>

<p>This application is using CSS GRID for it's primary layout.</p>

<p>The 'content' of the page is being routed using the Angular Router. The component is injected into the page after &lt;router-outlet&gt;.</p>

<p>See `app/app.component.scss` for the grid definition. `grid-area: content` should be applied automatically to the active routed component. If the style is applied correctly the background will change color.</p>
